# ForestPriorityAreas
Zonation assesment takes ecological aspects into consideration and scores areas based on these background factors. In this repo, Zonation priority assesment is utilized to select the top 30 % and top 10 % areas out of forest stands. These areas are then mirrored to the current conservation areas to possibly suggest priority forest areas.
